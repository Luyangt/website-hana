                    In <strong>2024</strong>, I served as one of the <strong>chief directors</strong> of the <strong>Greater Philadelphia Chinese New Year Gala</strong>,
                    a long-standing and well-recognized event celebrating the Lunar New Year in the region.
                    This annual event has been held for over a decade and has become a signature celebration for the 
                    Chinese community in Greater Philadelphia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Hosted by the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> and co-organized by <strong>Drexel University, 
                    Temple University, and Saint Joseph's University (SJU)</strong>, the three-hour gala featured 
                    <strong>a diverse program of performances</strong>, including<strong>singing, dancing, and theatrical acts</strong> , 
                    as well as a <strong>lucky draw segment</strong> to engage the audience. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Our goal was to create a festive atmosphere that brought the community together to celebrate 
                    this important cultural tradition. In 2024, the gala attracted nearly <strong>1,000 attendees</strong> and received 
                    <strong>overwhelmingly positive feedback</strong> from the community. It was a rewarding experience to 
                    bring this event to life and contribute to fostering cultural connections in the Greater Philadelphia area.
