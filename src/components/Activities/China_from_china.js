                My journey with the <strong>Penn Museum</strong> began in 2015 when I first toured the U.S. and visited the museum. 
                I was fascinated by its vast collection, especially the <strong>two Zhao Mausoleum Stone Steeds</strong> on display. 
                Coincidentally, the other four steeds were in Xi'an, the city where I pursued my undergraduate studies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the path of the <strong>Zhao Mausoleum Stone Steeds</strong>, I later joined the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> for my Ph.D. 
                studies. Alongside my research, I became an <strong>International Educator at the Penn Museum</strong>, 
                where I teach <strong>Chinese ceramic history</strong> to <strong>K6-K12</strong> students.

                My lectures are designed around the museum's collection and China's rich ceramic heritage. 
                I introduce students to <strong>the Terracotta Army, Tricolor-glazed Pottery, the Five Kilns of the Song Dynasty and Jian Kilns, and Blue and White china</strong> 
                , using these iconic pieces to explore the depth of Chinese culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond lectures, I have also organized <strong>guided tours in the Penn Museum's Asia Gallery</strong> and led specialized 
                <strong>Chinese ceramic history sessions for Mandarin-speaking audiences</strong>.
