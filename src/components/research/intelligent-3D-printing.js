        <p>
            In addition to developing <strong>3D printing inks</strong>, I was also responsible for the <strong>maintenance and customization</strong> of the laboratoryâ€™s 3D printers to meet the specific needs of our research group.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Customization of FDM Printer for DIW Printing</strong>: I started by modifying a <strong>MakerGear M2 FDM printer</strong>, removing its FDM components and integrating a <strong>pneumatic control system</strong> to convert it into a <strong>DIW (Direct Ink Writing)</strong> printer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Building an Intelligent 3D Printing System</strong>: Later, I worked on designing a <strong>custom 3D printing system</strong> based on an <strong>Aerotech gantry platform</strong>, incorporating <strong>pneumatic control units</strong>, <strong>temperature control systems</strong>, and <strong>real-time monitoring with cameras</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I implemented <strong>computer vision-based quality control</strong> by deploying a <strong>camera system on the printer</strong> to monitor DIW print quality. The printer was programmed to <strong>adjust printing parameters in real-time</strong> based on detected quality variations. This involved <strong>circuit design, mechanical structure design, C-based Arduino programming, Python programming, and AI techniques such as CNN and Transformer-based computer vision models</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Multi-Channel Pneumatic Control for Soft Robotics</strong>: To facilitate the control of <strong>soft robotic actuators</strong>, I developed a <strong>multi-channel pneumatic control system</strong>. This system used <strong>solenoid valves and PWM control</strong> to regulate output air pressure dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Exploring Advanced DIW Printing Techniques</strong>: Beyond system development, I also experimented with <strong>advanced DIW printing methods</strong>, including <strong>implanted 3D printing</strong>, <strong>sacrificial core-shell 3D printing</strong>, and <strong>multi-material printing</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These efforts contributed to expanding the capabilities of <strong>DIW 3D printing</strong> for a range of applications in <strong>soft robotics, functional materials, and complex geometries</strong>.
